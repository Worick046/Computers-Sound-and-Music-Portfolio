# Clipped Sine Wave

## Description 
---
The program [ClippedSine.py](https://github.com/Worick046/Computers-Sound-and-Music-Portfolio/blob/main/code/Clipped%20Sine%20Wave/ClippedSine.py) generates 2 .wav files named sine.wav and clipped.wav.
Both of these .wav files contain a 440 Hertz tone. The audio data used to generate the clipped.wav file
is then played on your computer's audio device.

[sine.wav](https://github.com/Worick046/Computers-Sound-and-Music-Portfolio/blob/main/code/Clipped%20Sine%20Wave/sine.wav)

This file contains a sine wave played at 440 Hertz.

[clipped.wav](https://github.com/Worick046/Computers-Sound-and-Music-Portfolio/blob/main/code/Clipped%20Sine%20Wave/clipped.wav)

This file contains a sine wave played at 440 Hertz at double the amplitude of sine.wav, but then clipped
to be the same amplitude.


## What I Learned
---
Through this project I learned how to generate .wav files, play audio, and manipulate audio data
to apply the symmetrical diode hard clip.
