# popgen: play a pop music loop
Bart Massey 2024

This Python program generates a pseudo-melody using chord
and bass notes from the [Axis
Progression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/axis_progression).

Right now, the controls are limited and the output is pretty
terrible.

A sample is available in [`demo.wav`](demo.wav).

# Modifications
Patrick Wood 2024

The program has improved note sounds that consist of added harmonics
to the original sine wave, a locked melody that won't go too high or too low,
and a rhythm generator that creates combinations of quarter and eighth notes.
