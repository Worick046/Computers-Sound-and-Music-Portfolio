# Sound Reconstructor

## Description
This program takes in a sound with a sample rate of 44100, computes the DFT, and reconstructs the sound
using the information from the DFT. Then it plays the original sound and reconstructed sound for comparison.

## What I learned
I learned more about the limitations of the DFT and more about how to work with the data that the DFT gives
me. I also learned how to increase the resolution of the DFT through zero padding so that I could get more
accurate frequencies that were not restricted to being integers.
