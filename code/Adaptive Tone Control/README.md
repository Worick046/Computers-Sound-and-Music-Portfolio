# Adaptive Tone Control

## Description
Equalize the energy in low frequency(1 - 300), mid frequency(300 - 2000), and high frequency(2000 and up) ranges
using an fft for measurement and audio filters to adjust the intensity of each range.

In Progress, Currenty have a way to measure the energy in the frequency ranges. Next step is to apply audio
filters.
