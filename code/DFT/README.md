# DFT

## Description
This program generates a waveform that consists of 2 sine waves at 440 hertz and 880 hertz.
It then performs a Fast Fourier Transform to get the individual frequencies and phases of each sine wave.
The program reconstructs the waveform from the information given by the transform and plays both samples.

## What I Learned
This project gave me an understanding on how to utilize Python libraries to perform a DFT and utillize
the results in a meaningful way.
