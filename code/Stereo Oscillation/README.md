# Stereo Oscillation
## Description
This program takes audio files and applies the 8D effect creating the sensation that sound is
moving around your head. In order to change the target you will need to change the filepaths in the program.
It applies the effect by scaling the audio in both channels by a sine wave. The channels are oppositely scaled
so while one channel gets louder, the other becomes quieter thus giving the effect of the sound moving around.

## What I Learned
I made this project to understand how to work with stereo audio in python. I learned how to take mono channel
audio and convert it to stereo and how to manipulate stereo audio.

## Music Used
The piece oscillations is an original composition by me and uses the musesounds playback library.
