I have started and completed project 1, the Clipped Sine Wave which involved learning how to generate playable
sine waves and clamping the maximum and minimum values. I have installed sounddevice on my computer to play
the audio data that I generate. The next thing I need to work on is filling in the main README.md file and
the README.md for the project.

Introduced myself on Zulip, the messaging platform the class is using. I said my name, my background in music
and expressed my excitement for the class. My exact words are below.

Hi everyone! My name is Patrick. I am an undergrad CS major and a Music minor. I am a member of the Portland
State Chamber Choir and take voice lessons through the music department. I've always been interested in the
combination of computers and music, and have recorded myself singing multiple parts of choral pieces to put
them together in a DAW. I am very excited to learn how audio works at a lower level and hopefully make some
cool sounds!
