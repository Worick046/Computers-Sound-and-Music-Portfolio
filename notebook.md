# Notebook

This notebook contains a chronological account of my work and progress in Computers, Sounds, and Music.

I have started and completed project 1, the Clipped Sine Wave which involved learning how to generate playable
sine waves and clamping the maximum and minimum values. I have installed sounddevice on my computer to play
the audio data that I generate. The next thing I need to work on is filling in the main README.md file and
the README.md for the project.


## 10/12/2024
Filled out the README.md to introduce the repository and Filled out the Clipped Sine Wave README.md
To describe the project and what I learned.

Introduced myself on Zulip, the messaging platform the class is using. I said my name, my background in music
and expressed my excitement for the class. My exact words are below.

Hi everyone! My name is Patrick. I am an undergrad CS major and a Music minor. I am a member of the Portland
State Chamber Choir and take voice lessons through the music department. I've always been interested in the
combination of computers and music, and have recorded myself singing multiple parts of choral pieces to put
them together in a DAW. I am very excited to learn how audio works at a lower level and hopefully make some
cool sounds!

## 10/22/2024
Made a new project called DFT to understand how to perform the Discrete Fourier Transform using Python libraries.

## 10/26/2024
Using the skills I learned from the DFT project I made a new project called Instrument Emulator in which I
further explored how to utilize the FFT by increaseing frequency resolution, and utilizing resuting
amplitudes. I will be testing on instrument sounds that are under a creative commons license next.

## 11/16/2024
I have renamed the Instrument Emulator project to Sound Reconstructor as I realized the 
scope of the project I was trying to do was too large to feasibly complete within a reasonable amount
of time. I finished the Sound Reconstructor project in which I learned more about the limits of DFT in which
the resulting data is much more dependent on the original sound than I had realized. I successfully recreated
the sound of a cello with pretty good accuracy.
