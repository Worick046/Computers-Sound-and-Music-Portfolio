This notebook contains a chronological account of my work and progress in Computers, Sounds, and Music.

I have started and completed project 1, the Clipped Sine Wave which involved learning how to generate playable sine waves and clamping the maximum and minimum values.
I have installed sounddevice on my computer to play the audio data that I generate.
The next thing I need to work on is filling in the main README.md file and the README.md for the project.
