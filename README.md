# Computers-Sound-and-Music-Portfolio

This is where all the projects related to CS 416P: Computers, Sounds, and Music are kept. Below are links to the README.md of each project.

You can see my 
[Notebook](https://github.com/Worick046/Computers-Sound-and-Music-Portfolio/blob/main/notebook.md)
to get diary entries of my work and progress.

# *Projects*
- [Clipped Sine Wave](https://github.com/Worick046/Computers-Sound-and-Music-Portfolio/tree/main/code/Clipped%20Sine%20Wave)

Generates two sounds, one is a regular sinewave and the other is a sinewave with a higher amplitude but clipped so the volume isn't actually higher.

- [DFT](https://github.com/Worick046/Computers-Sound-and-Music-Portfolio/tree/main/code/DFT)

Experimenting with learning how to use the Fourier Transform by bulding and sound, analyzing it and reconstructing it.

- [Sound Reconstructor](https://github.com/Worick046/Computers-Sound-and-Music-Portfolio/tree/main/code/Sound%20Reconstructor)

This project basically builds off the last project but instead of analyzing a sinewave this one analyzes and reconstructs
a sound sample of a cello.

- [Stereo Oscillation](https://github.com/Worick046/Computers-Sound-and-Music-Portfolio/tree/main/code/Stereo%20Oscillation)

This plays with oscillating the volume between channels in a stereo format creating the effect of sound travelling around.

- [Adaptive Tone Control](https://github.com/Worick046/Computers-Sound-and-Music-Portfolio/tree/main/code/Adaptive%20Tone%20Control)

Adaptive tone control attempts to balance out three frequency bands in a sound to make them equal.

- [Popgen](https://github.com/Worick046/Computers-Sound-and-Music-Portfolio/tree/main/code/Popgen)

Popgen is built off a preexisting program written by Bart Massey and is still mainly his code. I modified it to play a more interesting sound than
just sinewaves, locked the melody so it does not go too high or too low, and added a rhythm generator to play
more than just quarter notes.

- [Course Final Project AI Instrument Classification](https://github.com/Worick046/Computers-Sound-and-Music-Portfolio/tree/main/code/Course%20Project)

This project experiments with using AI for audio analysis by training a model on many instrument sound samples and
testing the model on new samples to see how well it works.
